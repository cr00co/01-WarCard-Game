|Description|
|-----------|
|This is a highly simplified version of the classic card game 'War', which relies purely on randomness and luck.|

|Rules of the Game|
|-----------------|
|• Each round, both the player and the CPU are dealt a random card from a standard deck.|
|• Whoever has the higher card value wins the round and scores a point.|
|• If both cards have the same value, each side receives a point.|
|• The first to reach 21 points wins the game.|
|• When the game ends, you can tap Play Again to restart and play again.|
